# Project Euler

These are some project euler solutions. I don't do them often, but I do enjoy
them as a way to play around with some languages.

This collection will have a variety of solutions in python3, sage, C++, C, and
common lisp. And maybe some classic unix commandline scripts when reasonable.
And maybe more? Who knows?

I don't own the problems, but in case any code here happens to be useful, it's
